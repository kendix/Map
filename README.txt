# PhotoJigsawPuzzle

Project as Described by Professor:

Take a photo (or image such as a satellite map). Cut it into jigsaw puzzle pieces and allow users
to reassemble the jigsaw puzzle on their device.
To make this more interesting we will make this a collaborative multi-player game for Maryland
Day. The photo will be a satellite map of the UM campus.
Users can work on the part of the puzzle near where they are actually standing. It will be interesting
to see whether together all users successfully reassemble the entire UM campus map.
